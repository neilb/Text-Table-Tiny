      in a suboptimal error message. Now croaks; added fatal test for this.
    - Added top_and_tail param, to address GH#3.
    - deleted unused internal function _get_cols_and_rows(). Devel::Cover++
    - Enabled Travis-CI. PR from Petr Kleteƒçka++.

    - Added this Changes file. Addresses RT#97285
    - Now use Exporter, and provide an optional export generate_table(),
      which works exactly the same as the previous table() function.

    - Restructured the doc.
    - Cleaned up the dist.ini, which now adds a META.json to releases.

      the See Also section in Text::Table::Manifold RT#107613.
    - Specified min perl version as 5.006
